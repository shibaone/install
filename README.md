## Installation scripts

Utility scripts that install binaries based on the operating system. The script will ask the user for root permission as required by installation.

### Setup

Clone this git repository

```
git clone https://github.com/shibaone/install.git
cd install
```

### Bor

#### Install default bor binary

```
./bor.sh
```

#### Install a specific bor version

Simply pass the version tag as the first argument to the installation script. Notice that the script will overwrite existing bor binaries if they exist. Example:

```


### Heimdall

```

#### Install a specific Heimdall version
